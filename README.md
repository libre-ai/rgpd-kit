# @libre-ai/rgpd-kit

Transverse RGPD/GDPR compliance brick for the constellation: typed models
(Art. 4–22), the `DataSubjectRightsPort` products implement, Art. 30
processing-register generation, DPIA (Art. 35) scaffolding, and a simplified
consent lifecycle with per-purpose Art. 7(4) checks.

Design: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-23-rgpd-kit-first-increment-design.md`
(option A — typed models + ports). First adopter: Sessions
(`apps/sessions/src/rgpd/`).

## The bounded-context hard rule

**Erasure, tombstones, receipts and audit trails are per-bounded-context,
per-database.** There is NO global deletion-receipt table, NO cross-context
audit log, NO centralized PII registry, and this package has **zero persistent
tables, zero migrations and zero runtime dependencies** — pure types,
validators and generators. Each product:

- implements `DataSubjectRightsPort` against its own store;
- owns its migrations, deletion queries and deletion receipts
  (`@libre-ai/data` per-product infrastructure);
- answers a data-subject request for its own context only. No transaction
  spans two databases; a request affects one product at a time.

A proposal that adds a shared erasure table or routes requests through a
central orchestrator is architecturally wrong here (design §7, option B —
rejected).

## Opaque subject digests (never plaintext PII)

Past `verifySubject`, everything speaks in opaque digests
(`deriveSubjectDigest`: domain-separated, tenant-scoped sha-256). Request
records, tombstones and audit rows never store the plaintext identifier; a
receipt is cross-referenced by digest inside the product's own database
(design Appendix B). Error messages in this package never echo identifier or
free-text values.

## How a product adopts the port

1. Depend on `@libre-ai/rgpd-kit` (`workspace:*`) and import
   `DataSubjectRightsPort` + the request/result types. No new types, no
   product-specific contracts.
2. Implement the port against the product's own store, with typed refusals
   (owner-prefixed codes like `sessions.rgpd.subject_unknown`).
3. Authorize BEFORE invoking the port (deny-by-default) — same boundary as
   `executeActiveDeletion` in `@libre-ai/data`.
4. Add the product's own migrations for tombstone/audit tables (append-only,
   FORCE RLS, tenant-scoped), in the product's `migrations/`.
5. Declare an Art. 30 `ProcessingActivity` (see
   `apps/sessions/art30-register.json`) referencing a retention rule id from
   `contracts/data/retention.v1.json`.
6. Integration-test the flow against the real grants (PGlite via
   `@libre-ai/testing`).

## Erasure semantics on append-only stores

Sessions' event log is structurally append-only (`GRANT SELECT, INSERT` only).
Art. 17 erasure therefore removes **logical access inside the accepted
transaction** — tombstone row + deletion receipt, both persisted atomically by
`executeActiveDeletion` — and physical compaction follows the owner-scoped
retention path (DATA-LIFECYCLE §Explicit deletion: "Physical compaction may
follow, but logical access … removed in the accepted transaction"). Such
categories declare `erasureScope: "deferred"`.

## Sessions example (first adopter)

- Port implementation: `apps/sessions/src/rgpd/data-subject-rights.ts`
  (access + erasure + portability implemented; restriction refuses
  `sessions.rgpd.not_implemented`, deferred).
- Tombstone + audit migrations: `apps/sessions/migrations/0002_rgpd.sql`
  (`session_deleted_subjects`, `session_subject_audit` — append-only, FORCE
  RLS).
- Request handler: `apps/sessions/src/rgpd/request-handler.ts` — exported
  factory, **not mounted** on the public cockpit routes: the Sessions runtime
  boundary stays locked until WP-G3-S01's `sessions-authz-review` human gate.
- Art. 30 entry: `apps/sessions/art30-register.json`.

## Deferred (documented, not silently dropped)

- **Consent withdrawal automation** — products keep simple consent models; a
  cross-product "revoke everywhere" surface is G3+.
- **DPIA approval workflow** — scaffold + manual template only
  (`docs/aida-template.md`); no CI wiring (owner decision 2026-07-23).
- **Cross-product request view** — each product tracks its own requests.
- **Subject-verification SLA** — products verify via existing session/email;
  no centralized identity broker.
- **Legal hold / court orders** — documented in ADR-0002 and DATA-LIFECYCLE
  §Legal hold; implementation deferred until the enforcement process is
  defined (owner decision 2026-07-23).
- **Sessions restriction (Art. 18)** — typed refusal until a bounded
  increment defines what pausing processing means for the append-only log
  (flag store + read-path contract); portability (Art. 20) is implemented.
