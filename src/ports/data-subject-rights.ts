// The port every PII-bearing product implements to expose its data-subject
// rights handlers (design §4.2, option A). The port is the ONLY coupling
// surface between rgpd-kit and a product: rgpd-kit owns the types, the
// product owns its data, migrations, deletion queries and receipts inside
// its bounded context. There is no orchestrator, no shared table, no
// cross-context transaction — a request affects one product at a time.
//
// AUTHORIZATION PRECONDITION: callers authorize the actor, tenant and scope
// BEFORE invoking any method here (deny-by-default), the same boundary as
// @libre-ai/data executeActiveDeletion. Reaching a port method means that
// gate already passed; implementations still fail closed on unknown or
// already-erased subjects with typed refusals.
//
// PII rule (design Appendix B): every method past verification speaks in
// opaque subject digests. The plaintext identifier appears once, in
// `verifySubject`, and is never persisted by any conforming implementation.
